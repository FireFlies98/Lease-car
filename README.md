# Hi everyone!

I have developed a fully responsive car leasing website based on a Figma design, which is adaptable for all devices. For this project, I used pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The implemented pages include the homepage, the new car selection page, and the contact page.

You can view the website and check how it works using this link: [Lease-car](https://fireflies98.github.io/Lease-car/)
