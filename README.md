# Hi everyone!

Hello!

I have developed a fully responsive car leasing website based on a Figma design, adaptable for all devices. For this project, I used pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

You can view the website and check how it works using this link: [Lease-car](https://fireflies98.github.io/Lease-car/)
